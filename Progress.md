Unity 2D game idea, i made the first steps in Unity to create my first game.

I get used to Unity , read about Unity for advices and watched videos of it.

Started the project named "Vikings Adventure".

Started with the gravity and the basic visual look of the game.

## Week 2
Started with the player movement script, then i gave it some animations.

Next step was the combat with animations.

After that i did some camera movement script lines.

I made some basic background music.

The last think i did was the Menus with the mainmenu and the pausemenu.

I did some changes in the game visualy too.
