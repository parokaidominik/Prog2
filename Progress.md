# Project 2021
## Week 1
Unity 2D game idea, i made the first steps in Unity to create my first game.

I get used to Unity , read about Unity for advices and watched videos of it.

Started the project named "Vikings Adventure".

Started with the gravity and the basic visual look of the game.

## Week 2
Started with the player movement script, then i gave it some animations.

Next step was the combat with animations.

After that i did some camera movement script lines.

I made some basic background music.

The last think i did was the Menus with the mainmenu and the pausemenu.

I did some changes in the game visualy too.

## Week 3
Made the enemy patrol system and attack system.

Now our Player can die and a gameover screen will open.

I have issue with the playercombat i will fix that later on.

I made some design changes too.
## Week 4
When an enemy dies it will fall down and stay there for the rest of the gameplay.

Our Player also lays down when he is dead but seconds later the gameover menu will pop up.

I made a story dialog in the start that explains why we go on and kill everybody.(not 100% done)

Made some design changes too and now there are more enemies in our way.
## Week 5
